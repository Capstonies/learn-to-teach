# Q&A

Q&A is ...

This app was built during a two-week sprint as the capstone project for four students at Fullstack Academy in Chicago. The project requirements were to create a prototype application that incorporated web technologies learned during the program, as well as new technologies we were interested in exploring. We decided to work with WebRTC and WebSockets to create a platform designed for real-time collaboration.
