# Q&A

Q&A is ...

This app was built during a two-week sprint as the capstone project for four students at Fullstack Academy in Chicago. The project requirements were to create a prototype application that incorporated web technologies learned during the program, as well as new technologies we were interested in exploring. We decided to work with WebRTC and WebSockets to create a platform designed for real-time collaboration.

## Technologies

* [React](https://reactjs.org) - JavaScript library for user interfaces
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org) - front-end state management
* [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) - open-source APIs that provide browsers and apps with real-time communication
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs) - library for real-time communication between server and client
* [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com) - an ORM for database queries
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) - object-relational database management system

## Getting started

These technologies are required:

* Node.js
* PSQL

### Setup

* `npm install`
* Create two PostgreSQL databases: `capstone` and `capstone-test`
* `npm run seed`

### Login credentials

| Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| teacher@example.com | test |
| student@example.com | test |

These credentials will work with the deployed application and a local install.
